## About This Project

Hello! I am a student learning how to code. This repository contains my practice programs and projects as I explore different programming concepts and languages.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Python Practice Files:** Small programs to practice logic, math, and graphics (like the heart shape using Turtle).
- **Fun Projects:** Simple games, converters, and creative coding exercises.
- **Learning Notes:** Comments and code samples that help me understand programming better.
